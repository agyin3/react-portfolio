## Features

**Animations**

There are a few animations that I implemented in the project. For the enter effects within the about and project sections I used Material UI transition components. I wanted each element to enter the screen once the user had scrolled down to the "top" of the element, so I added an event listener to track the scroll position. For the hero images at the top of the page, I wanted to experiment with using key frame animations and found an awesome library that made customizing the timing of the keyframes extremely easy.

**Admin Dashboard**

Implemented an admin dashboard to easily allow me to update my projects and information as needed. To build out this feature I used react-hook-form in combination with Material UI to handle logging in and adding/editing a project
